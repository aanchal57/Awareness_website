            <h3>Sanitary Napkins</h3>
            <p class="how-text" text-color="black">These are absorbent materials that catch menstrual blood when attached to the inside of girls underwear
              Some pads have extra material called 'wings' which helps to hold the pad in place and prevents leaking.
              <span class="dots" id="id-dots1">........</span> <span class="moreText" id="id-moretext1">Pads should be changed every 3-4 hours, even when there is a lighter flow, this helps 
                to prevent bacterial growth and stops odor. If the flow rate is heavier, then this period often reduces.
                Few of the girls have heavier blood flow while others have lighter flow during their periods. And most girls have ligher days and heavier days.
                Pads or sanitary napkins can vary by size or absorbency. Depending on these factors, there are different kinds of sanitary napkins: super, slender,
                overnight, scented, mini, maxi. So, to find a right pad, there is a need to do a little bit of experimentation.

              <h3>Tempons</h3>
              <p class="how-text" text-color="black">A tempon is made up of absorbent material compressed in a small tube. Tempons come in different sizes and absorbecies
                for heavier and lighter period. Some tempons come with the applicator, used to guides the tempon inside vagina.
                <span class="dots" id="id-dots2">........</span> 
                <span class="moreText" id="id-moretext2">
                 While other tempons are inserted using fingers. After applying tempons into the vagina and washing your hand, make sure to follow the directions that come 
                 with the tempons carefully and relax. It is necessary to change a tempon every 4-6 hours or when it gets saturated with blood.
                 Tempons have a string attached to its end that stays out of the girl's body. To remove the tempon, the string is gently pull on, untill
                 the tempon comes out. If it is the time to change tempon and string can't be found, one have to reach in with their fingers.
                 Tempons need to be change often, because if left too long for inside, it can generate infection, odor or discharge in girl's vagina.

            </p>
          <h4 class="block-41-heading mb-3">Diagnosis</h4>
            <p class="how-text-row1">When a doctor suspects menorrhagia, they will inquire about the patient's symptoms, medical history, and menstrual cycle patterns. They might perform a physical examination as well.
            <br>Menorrhagia can be identified using the following tests:
            <br>blood tests to look for coagulation issues, thyroid issues, and anaemia
            <br>Endometrial biopsy to check the lining of the uterus for cellular abnormalities
            <br>Cancer Pap smear to check for cervical infection, inflammation, and malignancy
            <br>Ultrasound to examine the uterus, cervix, and ovaries as well as other pelvic organs
            <br>Ultrasound is used during a sonohysterogram to check for abnormalities after injecting fluid into the uterus.
            <br>Dilation and curettage, which a doctor may employ to find and treat anomalies.</br>
            </p>
          <h4 class="block-41-heading mb-3">Prevention</h4>

              The patient's age, general health, medical history, preferences, and needs with regard to menstruation will all be taken into account by the doctor.
              <br>Drug therapy includes iron supplements to treat anemia,birth control pills to make periods more regular, reduce bleeding, or stop bleeding completely,
              tranexamic acid (Lysteda), a prescription medication that a person takes each month at the time of bleeding to help reduce blood loss,

          <h2 class="block-41-heading mb-3">Irregular Periods (Oligomenorrhea)<h2>
          <p class="text-1">Someone is said to have irregular periods if their menstrual cycle is less than 24 days, lasts longer than 38 days, 
            or fluctuates greatly from month to month. Doctors refer to this as oligomenorrhea.
          <br>Particularly for those who are going through adolescence, nursing, or on the verge of menopause, it is typical for the menstrual cycle length to vary slightly from month to month.
          Stress, drugs, and illnesses related to the mind or body can all alter how frequently a woman gets her period.

          <span class="sub-more" id="sub-text-more4">
          <h4 class="block-41-heading mb-3">Symptoms and Causes</h4>
          <p class="how-text-row1">The main symptom of irregular periods are menstruation arrving sooner or later,
            abnormal bleeding, time between periods vary.
           <br>Irregular periods, or oligomenorrhea, can occur for many reasons. Many relate to hormone levels. If something disrupts or alters how hormones (like estrogen, progestrone and 
           follicle-stimulating hormone) rise and fall each cycle, it can cause irregular periods.
           <p class="how-text-row1"><br>Other factors that may contribute to irregular periods include:
          <br><i>Natural Hormonal shifts</i>: It takes several years for the hormones that regulate periods to fall into a reliable pattern. During this time, it is common to have irregular periods.
          Oligomenorrhea can also occur after childbirth and while breastfeeding until the hormones return to normal after having a baby.
          Periods also become irregular during perimenopause, which is the first stage of menopause. During this time, hormone levels begin to fall.</br>
           <br><i>Hormonal birth control></i>:Hormonal birth control works by stopping ovulation.A person may experience irregular bleeding for the first few months after using such a pill, patch, implant, or hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). 
           With time, this could either stop totally or grow more frequent.<br>Likewise, irregular periods might result from ceasing to use hormonal birth control. The body's hormonal cycle takes some time to get back to its regular rhythm.
           After discontinuing birth control pills, most people experience a withdrawal bleed for two to four weeks. Period bleeding follows. The cycle may not settle into a regular rhythm for up to 3 months.
           <br><i> Eating Disorder</i>:Eating disordersTrusted Source, such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder, can cause absent or irregular periods. 
           This is more likely to occur if someone has experienced severe weight loss.
           <br><i>Mdeical conditions:</i>Some medical conditions like endometriosis, thyroid disease, type 1diabetes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
           hormone-secreting tumors can lead to irregular periods</br>
          </p>
          </p>
          <h4 class="block-41-heading mb-3">Diagnosis</h4>
            <p class="how-text-row1">Contact your healthcare provider if you have any symptom of irregular period. Depending on your specific symptoms, diagnostic tests may include:
             <br> PAP test: This test looks for various infections or cancer cells on the cervix.
              <br>Blood test: Blood tests will detect anemia, blood clotting problems, and thyroid function.
              <br>Pelvic ultrasound: Pelvic ultrasound will create images of your uterus, ovaries, and pelvis.
              <br>Endometrial biopsy: If your doctor wants to evaluate potential problems with your uterus, he or she may order an endometrial biopsy. During this procedure, a sample of uterine tissue was taken so that it can be analyzed. They can also use a diagnostic hysteroscopy to view the inside of your uterus. Your doctor will use an enhanced tube to examine the uterus and remove the polyp for a hysteroscopy.
              <br>Sonohysterogram: A sonohysterogram is an ultrasound that involves injecting fluid into the uterus to help get a picture of the uterine cavity. Then your doctor can look for polyps or fibroids.
              <br>Pregnancy test: Your doctor may order a pregnancy test.</br>
            </p>
          <h4 class="block-41-heading mb-3">Prevention</h4>

              <br>This comprises of maintaining a healthy weight and lowering stress, routinely exercise,eat a balanced diet.
              <br>Although research has not proved the usefulness of some herbal medicines, including black cohosh, chaste berries, licorice root, and turmeric, they are considered to be helpful. They also may have negative effects.</br>
            </p>
            <h4 class="block-41-heading mb-3">Treatment</h4>
